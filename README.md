## Data available

- Solubility of common salts at ambient temperatures. Solubility values are
given in molality terms and temperature values in celsius. Reference: Rumble, J.

## Usage

See the tutorials files for each data set.

## Under the hood - requirements

This project relies mainly on Pandas, SciPy, Matplotlib and numpy.
